# Before creating the plan
Before proposing a plan, ask 4-6 clarifying questions based on your findings. Once answered, draft a comprehensive plan document that includes the parts listed below. When asking the questions, if there are obvious, list possible options. A few, two or three, to that question's answer.

# PLAN PARTS
