Whenever you are creating code, take these context and rules into account:

# FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES
ALWAYS use cmd for commands
ALWAYS write simple, clean and modular code. The shorter the better.

# Comments
ALWAYS try to add more helpful and explanatory comments into our code. NEVER delete old comments - unless they are obviously wrong/obsolete.
Do not delete comments unless they are no longer needed or are outdated.

MOST IMPORTANT: ONLY focus on making the changes to fix/add what the user requested. KEEP EVERYTHING ELSE THE SAME.

# ERROR FIXING PROCESS
Study the code, the logs and the context (related files, code blocks, etc). 
If clear, fix the issue and send the fixed code.
If not clear, 2 options:
  Add logs and ask user to run and send the logs.
  Ask user for more information.


# IMPORTANT: 
Understand the entire context of the project. When information is needed, look at the files in /docs directory.
When you get a prompt, check MCP cursor rule, think if an MCP Server can be used. If so, use it.

# MOST IMPORTANT: ONLY FOCUS ON AND MAKE THE CHANGES THE USER REQUESTS.
