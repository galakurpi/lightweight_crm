- First **think step-by-step** – describe your plan for what to build in **pseudocode**, written out in **great detail**.
- **Confirm, then write code!**
- Always write **correct**, **best practice**, **DRY principle (Don’t Repeat Yourself)**, **bug free**, **fully functional and working code** aligned to **Code Implementation Guidelines** below.
- Focus on **easy and readability** code, over being performant.
- Fully implement **all requested functionality**.
- Leave **NO todos, placeholders or missing pieces**.
- Ensure code is **complete**. **Verify thoroughly** finalised.
- Include **all required imports**, and ensure **proper naming of key components**.

## Code Implementation Guidelines

Follow these rules when you write code:

1. **Use early returns** whenever possible to make the code more readable.
3. Use `class:` directive instead of the ternary operator in class tags whenever possible.
4. Use **descriptive variable and function/const names**.
   - Event handlers must be named with a `handle` prefix (e.g., `handleClick`, `handleKeyDown`).
5. Implement **accessibility features** on elements.
   - Example for clickable elements:
     - `tabindex="0"`
     - `aria-label`
     - `onClick`
     - `onKeyDown`
6. Use `const` instead of function declarations.
   - Example: `const toggle = () => {}`.
   - Define a `type` if possible.
