 # INSTRUCTIONS FOR MCP SERVERS
Every time the prompt has the word "mcp" in it, you will have to use an MCP Server.

## AVAILABLE MCP SERVERS
The MCP Servers available are the following:
browser_tools (for frontend debugging)
    Use browser_tools MCP only at the beginning of the work, ONLY before making changes.


When the prompt has "mcp", think well which tool of which server to use, and use it/them to achieve the goal set by the user.
