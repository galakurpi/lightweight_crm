# FRONTEND RULES
Put each element in a new Svelte component in a new file. Keep the files organized.
Prioritize code quality: small, reusable components; no duplication. Create new components if needed.
Maintain clean UI: consistent naming (e.g., `Button`, `Card`) and minimal props.
Use "browser_tools" MCP server ONLY BEFORE changing the code.
ONLY focus on the changes requested, nothing else.
DO NOT add comments in the html code parts
Do not execute any command to update frontend, nor any "npm" command.
