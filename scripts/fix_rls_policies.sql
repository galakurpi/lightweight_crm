-- Fix RLS Policies for Django Backend
-- This script updates the RLS policies to work properly with our Django authentication

-- ================================
-- OPTION 1: Disable RLS for application tables (recommended for now)
-- Since we're already filtering by user_id in our Django code
-- ================================

-- Disable RLS for conversations, messages, and leads
-- Keep RLS enabled for users table for security
ALTER TABLE conversations DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE messages DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE leads DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop the problematic policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own conversations" ON conversations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert own conversations" ON conversations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own conversations" ON conversations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete own conversations" ON conversations;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view messages in own conversations" ON messages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert messages in own conversations" ON messages;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own leads" ON leads;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert own leads" ON leads;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own leads" ON leads;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete own leads" ON leads;
